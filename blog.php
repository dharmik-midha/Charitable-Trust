      <i><p>Most of us have grown up on stories narrated to us by our grandparents, parents and other elders in the family. They were the good old days when we would lie beside our grannies as they took us on fantasy journeys with their tales Stories have the power to take children to far & new places, introduce them to some extraordinary people and eye-opening situations and in turn expand and enrich their world.

      <i><p>Drawing and creating their own characters and designs helped the children to think creatively. It was a big boost to their hand-eye coordination and pushed them to conceptualize new ideas. We also indulged in some logo designing with children post this session where they designed their own equivalents of Iron man & Superman logos. 
        <p>
      All in all, it was a joyous learning experience both for the children and the volunteers. </p></i>

    <div class="r-container ">
      <i><p>The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act (RTE), describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under Article 21a of the Indian Constitution. India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the Act came into force on 1 April 2010. Section 12(1)(c) of the Right To Education Act guarantees free education for economically weaker and socially backward children in private schools. <p><b><i>A study by Indus Action has shown that the benefit for a family is Rs.1,00,000/- per child over 10 years. </i></b></p>
<p>
The biggest problems in realising this right are awareness and accessibility and Bhumi has been working actively on both domains. Mere one-time support to these children can be a life-transforming opportunity for these families and a wonderful chance at developing socially inclusive societies.</i>

    <div class="r-container">
    <i> <p>One of its kind initiatives, Nakshatra is Bhumi’s annual inter-shelter home art, cultural, and sports talent fest for children to exhibit their talents and explore the potential in an atmosphere of healthy competition.

Bhumi’s Bengaluru team decided to take the concept of Nakshatra a notch up by making it inclusive and organising Nakshatra Specials, a day of fun and talent for specially-abled children. Their own special Nakshatra!

We asked Dhruv Patel, Bengaluru’s Chapter coordinator to share with us a few insights about this newly launched initiative. </p></i>
<i><p>Often children with special abilities get little or limited opportunity to interact and reveal their talents to the world. Nakshatra Specials provides a platform for them to shine. Nakshatra Specials is not a competition, it is a celebration involving these special children. Here every child is a winner! ,Nakshatra Specials had four broad categories of events – arts, cultural, literature, and games. Volunteers dressed up as clowns and comic characters stole hearts and kept the excitement going! , Nakshatra Specials needed a lot of additional preparation as compared to a regular Nakshatra. We organised four pre-Nakshatra events at schools/homes where more than 70% of the volunteers were trained on how to work with differently-abled children. Volunteers were given a basic working knowledge of sign language to prepare them for the D-Day.</p></i>

      <i><p>Lakshya programme helps to enrich the lives of underprivileged children (mentees) through a caring relationship with a personal mentor who supports, encourages, and builds their self-confidence. It also enables children from classes 8 and above to complete the cycle of growth by guiding them to focus on a career of their choice or need. 
</p><P>
In one of the Lakshya sessions in Chennai, art from junk was initiated- a fun and exciting way for children to explore new ways of working with different materials.
</P><p>
The most recent session was not only an opportunity for children to showcase their creativity, but also tap into their fine and gross locomotor skills for higher-order skills such as sequencing, hypothesis testing, analysis, and evaluation. It also built confidence & developed negotiation and communication skills in children (verbal and non-verbal). The materials used in the activity enabled children to realise how waste can aid in experiential learning – be it cereal boxes, egg boxes, bottle tops, foil trays, product packaging, or small pipes, fabric remnants, buttons, etc.</p></i>

    <div class="r-container">
      <I><p>Disability affects more than one billion people worldwide, according to the United Nations. Disability inclusion means understanding the relationship between the way people function and how they participate in society and making sure everybody has the same opportunities to participate in every aspect of life to the best of their abilities and desires.
</p><p>
In alignment with this concept of inclusion, we at Bhumi decided to celebrate the festival of lights at Vidyasagar (Kotturpuram) with our friends in wheelchairs. It was made clear that it’s going to be an inclusive celebration with music, games, fun activities, & an informative session on supporting differently-abled members. We started with a prayer song sung by one of the volunteers, followed by a speech from Ms. Ummul Kher (advocate) who requested the audience for their support and encouragement towards the differently-abled members. 
</p><P>
The fun began with a relay game where teams were formed with equal participation from Bhumi volunteers and Vidyasagar members. This was enjoyed by everyone with lots of hoots & cheering and some yummy refreshments afterward. The evening continues with songs and dances performed by our volunteers and relished by the Vidyasagar members. </p>

      <i><p>Eco-Champs is a volunteer-driven program of Bhumi, to inculcate eco-friendly habits among school-going children in their day-to-day life.
<p>
The program is designed to encourage students to connect with the environment through various activities, which aim to instigate behavioral changes that emphasize the need for environmental preservation through eco-friendly, sustainable practices.
</p><P>
 Here is a vivid testimonial from one of our passionate volunteers Agnija.
</P><P>
“I volunteered for this program at the beginning of season 2. This is quite an intriguing program. Your main responsibility is to teach school children about sustainable development. Every school you take up is a project on its own! To start, one needs to communicate with the school stakeholders, then strategise & plan the sessions, This leads to continuous brainstorming on interesting and engaging ways to conduct the activities for the school children.
